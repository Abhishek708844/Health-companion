Can you tell me what is this red scar?","Hello Abhishek Singh, based on the image, I suspect that the red scar on your arm could be a result of either a burn, possibly a minor one, or an allergic reaction, such as contact dermatitis; some remedies that may help alleviate the symptoms include applying a topical cream or ointment containing hydrocortisone to reduce inflammation and itching, and using cool compresses or taking an oral antihistamine to soothe the skin and relieve any discomfort.",,2025-08-30 17:47:21.856387

How to cure it?,"Based on the image, I suspect that you are suffering from acne vulgaris, a common skin condition characterized by inflamed and non-inflamed lesions on the face. I would recommend a combination of topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and oral antibiotics, such as doxycycline or minocycline, to help control the acne, along with good skincare habits, including gentle cleansing and moisturizing, and lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet and reducing stress.",.gradio\flagged\Doctors Voice\29b52f2725f3101131bb\final.mp3,2025-08-30 18:36:05.363901
